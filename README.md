Distinctive Theme Clock

Themed Clock with JS, CSS, and HTML
This project is a clock that displays the current time using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The clock has two themes: light mode and dark mode, which can be toggled using a button.

The clock hands are animated and move smoothly to show the time in real-time. The code is written using modern JavaScript syntax and basic CSS and HTML.
